    "<p>Chef is a farmer and a pet lover. He has a lot of his favorite pets cats and dogs in the barn. He does\n",
    "not know their exact count. But he knows that there are C cats and Ddogs in the barn. Also, one day\n",
    "went to field and found that there were L legs of the animals touching the ground. Chef knows that\n",
    "cats love to ride on the dogs. So, they might ride on the dogs, and their legs won't touch the ground\n",
    "and Chef would miss counting their legs. Chef's dogs are strong enough to ride at max two cats on\n",
    "their back.\n",
    "It was a cold foggy morning, when Chef did this counting. So he is now wondering whether he\n",

    "Input\n",
    "First line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. T test cases follow.\n",

    "Example 2. There is one cat and one dog. The number of legs of these animals on the ground are 4,\n",
    "it can be possible if the cat will ride on the dog, so its legs won't be counted by Chef, only the dog's\n",
    "legs will be counted.\n",
    "Example 3. There is one cat and one dog. The number of legs of these animals are 2, it can not be\n",
    "true at all, Chef might have made some mistake. Hence answer is \"no\"."
