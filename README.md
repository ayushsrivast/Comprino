# Coding Interview Practice Repository

Welcome to my Coding Interview Practice Repository! This repository contains a collection of **10 commonly asked coding problems** that I have encountered in **coding rounds** during interviews, as well as problems that I have personally worked on. These problems cover a variety of topics and are designed to help you practice common algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

## Table of Contents

- [Fibonacci Series](#question-1-fibonacci-series)
- [Gross Salary](#question-10-gross-salary)
- [Id and Ship](#question-11-id-and-ship)
- [Ordering Teams](#question-2-ordering-teams)
- [Temple Land](#question-3-temple-land)
- [Bear and Milky Cookies](#question-4-bear-and-milky-cookies)
- [Beautiful Array](#question-5-beautiful-array)
- [Cats and Dogs](#question-6-cats-and-dogs)
- [Sticks](#question-7-sticks)
- [Two Numbers](#question-8-two-numbers)
- [Minimum Maximum](#question-9-minimum-maximum)

Each problem is stored as a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**. You can open and run them locally or in any cloud-based notebook service like Google Colab.
